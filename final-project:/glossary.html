                <h3>step one: understanding your dataset</h3>

                <p>
                    your dataset should contain will contain at least a thousand instances and an assortment of features. 
                    the final column in your dataset will always be the class value. 
                    there are a few types of features, but for now, it is important to know that they are either nominal or numeric. 
                    if your class value is nominal, you will be solving a classification problem.   
                    if your class value is numeric, you will be solving a regression problem.
                    what is interesting is that in a supervised machine learning, a machine requires numerous instances to confirm a pattern. 
                    alternatively, humans can learn from one instance if the instance is threatening enough.
